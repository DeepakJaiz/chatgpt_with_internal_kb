       "1. **Policy Compliance:** Standardised development tools and environment that is set up in compliance with **Application Infrastructure Architecture Standard (AIAS)** and **Instruction Manual 8 on Information Technology (IM8)** policies.\n",
       "2. **Better Quality:** Automated security testing detects vulnerabilities early in the development cycle helping to deliver high quality applications. SHIP-HATS allows agencies to follow prescriptive workflow templates and share knowledge among themselves.\n",
       "3. **Visibility & Transparency:** Agencies will always have access to source code and hence a better understanding of how the project is progressing.\n",
       "4. **Shortened Time-to-market:** Agencies can shorten the time to market by leveraging on SHIP-HATS CI/CD tools with predefined & re-usable configurations into their system and do not have to invest in resources/time to do procurement with different commercial providers. Agencies also do not have to invest resources to re-train staff who were re-deployed across agencies.\n",
       "5. **Economies of Scale:** SHIP-HATS purchases licenses in bulk and redistributes them for use in smaller quantities to agencies and is offered as a complete package with no hidden cost.\n",
       "6. **GovTech Managed:** The CI/CD tools are procured and managed by GovTech letting you focus on your core application.\n",
       "7. **Performance Management Dashboard:** Value-Stream Measurement capabilities that allow Agencies to capture key industry metrics, such as lead time to deployment and deployment frequency, to monitor the effectiveness of their DevSecOps practices\n",
